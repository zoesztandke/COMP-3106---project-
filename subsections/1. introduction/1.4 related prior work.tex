\subsection{Related prior work}
Prior research has explored eye-state classification using a range of machine-learning methods. 

\cite{Nilashi2023} achieved an accuracy of 94.3\% using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) with a bagged decision tree. Similarly, \cite{Elshewey2024} applied a variety of techniques optimisation techniques, achieving 96.1\% accuracy with a k-Nearest Neighbours classifier after applying the genetic algorithm to refine the dataset.

These studies demonstrate that high accuracies are possible when advanced methods are applied.
