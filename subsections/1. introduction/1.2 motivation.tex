\subsection{Motivation}
Neuroscience remains one of the most rapidly evolving fields, with many areas still misunderstood. Machine learning offers a groundbreaking way to uncover structure and patterns within brain signals. Although eye-state detection from EEG is a relatively simple task, it provides a useful introduction to analysing neural time-series data and forms a foundation for more advanced projects.
