\subsection{Background}
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique that measures electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. EEG data can reveal many patterns that indicate brain function. An example of this is eye state detection. Determining whether a person's eyes are open or closed based on EEG signals is useful in applications such as drowsiness detection, emotion and stress monitoring, personal authentication, and driver alertness monitoring (\cite{Nilashi2023}). \\ 

The objective of this project is to classify EEG signals to detect whether a subject's eyes are open or closed. The model will compare the performance of several machine learning approaches and evaluate which is most suitable for EEG classification tasks.
