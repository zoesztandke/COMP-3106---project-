\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset used in this project is the famous EEG Eye State dataset, provided in ARFF format and originating from the Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) in Stuttgart, Germany. \\ \\
It contains 14,980 consecutive EEG measurements, each consisting of activity recorded from fourteen scalp electrodes placed according to the international 10-20 system, as in Figure~\ref{fig:electrodeAreas}. \\ \\
The data show a slightly imbalanced distribution, with 6,723 instances of eyes closed and 8,257 instances of eyes open. The features consist of 14 continuous EEG readings and a single binary label column, indicating whether the participant's eyes were open (0) or closed (1) at the time of recording. The feature data is a continuous time series, and the dataset contains no missing or NaN values. The column labels are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The EEG data is: \textbf{AF3, F7, F3, FC5, T7, P7, O1, O2, P8, T8, FC6, F4, F8, AF4}
    \item The label column is: \textbf{eyeDetection (open (0), closed (1))}
\end{itemize}
