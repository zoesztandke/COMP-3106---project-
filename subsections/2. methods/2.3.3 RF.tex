\subsubsection{Random Forest Classifier}
A Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble method that constructs many decision trees using bootstrap samples of the data, and averages their predictions. This reduces overfitting and typically performs well on high-dimensional, noisy, and non-linear datasets. \\
Random Forests are well suited to EEG data because they capture non-linear relationships and are robust to noise. Again, this was reflected in the results.
