\subsubsection{Overall Performance}
Random Forest achieved a marginally higher accuracy than SVM and kNN on the PCA transformed data, but showed a substantial improvement on the temporally smoothed data. \\

Temporal smoothing boosted Random Forest performance, while kNN experienced slightly decreased performance, and SVM only saw small increase. \\

Although PCA effectively reduced dimensionality, the substantial overlap between classes limited its impact on overall accuracy for all models. Nonetheless, both kNN and Random Forest performed roughly 15\% above random guessing, indicating that meaningful patterns were still present within the overlapping data.
