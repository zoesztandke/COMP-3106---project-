\subsection{Limitation of work}
Although PCA and temporal smoothing were investigated, the scope was limited. Given additional time, further dimensionality reduction and temporal smoothing techniques could have been explored to better capture the structure of EEG signals. \\

The hyperparameter searches were limited to relatively small grids due to computational limitations. Broader optimisation methods may have yielded more robust models. \\

Evaluation relied heavily on balanced accuracy. Additional metrics, such as F1-score and ROC curves, would have provided a more complete picture of model behaviour.
