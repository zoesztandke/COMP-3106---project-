\subsection{Implication of work}
Although the task examined is relatively simple, it is clear that even using the most simple machine learning methods, meaningful patterns can be extracted from noisy EEG recordings. \\

The differences in performance between PCA transformed and temporally smoothed data highlight the importance of preserving temporal structure in EEG signals.
