@article{kNNperformance,
	abstract = {The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) method, established in 1951, has since evolved into a pivotal tool in data mining, recommendation systems, and Internet of Things (IoT), among other areas. This paper presents a comprehensive review and performance analysis of modifications made to enhance the exact kNN techniques, particularly focusing on kNN Search and kNN Join for high-dimensional data. We delve deep into 31 kNN search methods and 12 kNN join methods, providing a methodological overview and analytical insight into each, emphasizing their strengths, limitations, and applicability. An important feature of our study is the provision of the source code for each of the kNN methods discussed, fostering ease of experimentation and comparative analysis for readers. Motivated by the rising significance of kNN in high-dimensional spaces and a recognized gap in comprehensive surveys on exact kNN techniques, our work seeks to bridge this gap. Additionally, we outline existing challenges and present potential directions for future research in the domain of kNN techniques, offering a holistic guide that amalgamates, compares, and dissects existing methodologies in a coherent manner.},

@article{Elshewey2024,
	abstract = {This article introduces the Modified Al-Biruni Earth Radius (MBER) algorithm, which seeks to improve the precision of categorizing eye states as either open (0) or closed (1). The evaluation of the proposed algorithm was assessed using an available EEG dataset that applied preprocessing techniques, including scaling, normalization, and elimination of null values. The MBER algorithm's binary format is specifically designed to select features that can significantly enhance the accuracy of classification. The proposed algorithm and competing ones, namely, Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WAO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were evaluated using predefined sets of assessment criteria. The statistical analysis employed the ANOVA and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and assessed the effectiveness and significance of the proposed algorithm compared to the other five algorithms. Furthermore, A series of visual depictions were presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Thus, the MBER algorithm outperformed the other optimizers on the majority of the unimodal benchmark functions due to these considerations. Different ML models were used for classification, e.g., DT, RF, KNN, SGD, GNB, SVC, and LR. The KNN model achieved the highest values of Precision (PPV) (0.959425), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) (0.964969), FScore (0.963431), accuracy (0.9612), Sensitivity (0.970578) and Specificity (0.949711). Thus, KNN serves as a fitness function and is optimized by the utilization of Modified Al-Biruni earth radius (MBER). Finally, the accuracy of eye state classification achieved 96.12{\%} using the proposed algorithm.},
